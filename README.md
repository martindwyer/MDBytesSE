This project initiated with a very useful <a href="https://youtu.be/Dk6Wopar10k">YouTube tutorial</a> by Dave Gray. I highly recommend checking out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DaveGrayTeachesCode/featured">Dave's YouTube channel</a>. Version 0.0.0 listed above is primarily the result of Dave's tutorial.

Dave has an excellent handle on a wide range of web development topics, but finishing this tutorial left me with a desire to expand and revise the application in three certain ways, which will be released as three major releases:

<ol>
<li>To revise the application from vanilla JavaScript to REACT framework.  Performance ratings for the vanilla JavaScript application are not very good.  Performance should improve in a REACT app, which should also give room for further development.</li>
<li>With more room for development, a larger result set, along with pagination, can be pursued.</li>
<li>The expansion of API services for information can be pursued. </li>
</ol>

I have a huge commitment to open source learning. This project is available under open source license.However, I have no patience for those who plagiarize for academic success. The public access of this repository means that plagiarized code can be googled and found to have originated here.
